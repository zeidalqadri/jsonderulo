Let's follow this exact string through every transformation:

### ðŸ”¤ Initial Raw String
```
"analyze customer feedback to identify pain points and generate action items"
```

### ðŸ“Š Stage 1: IdeaInputProcessor â†’ EnrichedIdea

**What happens**: Text normalization, concept extraction, categorization

    estimatedCost: 0.025,
    temperature: 0.7,
    fallbackProviders: ["anthropic"],
    timeout: 30000
  }
}
```

### âš¡ Stage 4: PromptOptimizer â†’ OptimizedPrompt

**What happens**: Adds examples, reasoning steps, and optimizes for model

**Transformation**:
```javascript
// INPUT (Schema + Prompt from Stage 3)

// OUTPUT (OptimizedPrompt):
{
  prompt: `You are an expert customer experience analyst. Generate structured, actionable insights from customer feedback data following the provided JSON schema.

## Task
Analyze the following customer feedback data and generate action items based on identified pain points.

## Examples
Here's an example of the expected output format:

Input: "Customers report that the login process takes too many steps and the password reset is confusing."
Output:
{
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "title": "Simplify login flow",
      "description": "Reduce login steps from 5 to 3 by implementing social login and remember me functionality",
      "priority": "high",
      "category": "Authentication",
      "estimatedImpact": "Reduce login-related support tickets by 40%",
      "evidenceFrom": ["Multiple users mentioned 'too many steps'", "15% abandon rate at login"]
    }
  ],
  "insights": [
    {
      "finding": "Authentication is a major friction point",
      "evidence": ["45% of negative feedback mentions login", "High abandon rate"],
      "recommendation": "Prioritize authentication improvements in next sprint"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Analysis of customer feedback reveals authentication as the primary pain point..."
}

## Reasoning Steps
1. First, categorize all feedback by theme (authentication, performance, features, etc.)
2. Identify the most frequent pain points and their impact
3. Generate specific, measurable action items for each major pain point
4. Provide evidence-based insights with clear recommendations
5. Summarize findings in an executive-friendly format

## Requirements
- Focus on: customer feedback, pain points, action items
- Must be data-driven with evidence for each recommendation
- Provide 3-10 action items prioritized by impact
- Include metrics where possible

Now analyze the customer feedback and provide your response:`,

  examples: [
    {
      input: "Login process is confusing, takes too many steps",
      output: {
        actionItems: [{
          title: "Simplify login flow",
          description: "Reduce steps from 5 to 3",
          priority: "high",
          category: "Authentication",
          estimatedImpact: "Reduce support tickets by 40%"
        }]
      }
    },
    {
      input: "App crashes when uploading large files",
      output: {
        actionItems: [{
          title: "Fix file upload stability",
          description: "Implement chunked upload for files >10MB",
          priority: "high",
          category: "Performance",
          estimatedImpact: "Eliminate 90% of upload-related crashes"
        }]
      }
    }
  ],
  
  reasoning: [
    { step: 1, instruction: "Categorize feedback by theme", output: "categories" },
    { step: 2, instruction: "Identify pain points and frequency", output: "painPoints" },

    { step: 4, instruction: "Create evidence-based insights", output: "insights" },

The primary issue is an overwhelming onboarding process that causes 67% of new users to churn before experiencing product value. Secondary issues include poor navigation/search capabilities and lack of efficiency tools for power users. Addressing these pain points through the recommended action items could improve retention by 35%, reduce support costs by 45%, and increase user satisfaction significantly. Priority should be given to onboarding redesign and search implementation as these affect all user segments.",

## Summary

This diagram shows how a simple string transforms through 7 stages:

1. **Text â†’ Concepts**: Raw string becomes categorized with extracted entities
2. **Concepts â†’ Query**: Entities become structured query components  
3. **Query â†’ Schema**: Components become JSON schema with validation rules
4. **Schema â†’ Optimized Prompt**: Schema becomes model-specific prompt with examples
5. **Prompt â†’ AI Response**: Optimized prompt generates structured output
6. **Response â†’ Validated Data**: Output is validated and potentially repaired
7. **Data â†’ Insights**: Execution patterns analyzed for continuous improvement

Each transformation adds structure, context, and optimization, turning a simple string into actionable, validated business insights with full traceability and quality assurance.
